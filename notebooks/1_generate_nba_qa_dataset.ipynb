    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset generation process:\n",
    "1. **Fetch NBA Data**: Retrieve player statistics and game logs from the NBA API\n",
    "2. **Generate Context**: Convert structured data into natural language passages\n",
    "3. **Create QA Pairs**: Generate questions and extract answer spans\n",
    "4. **Format for Training**: Save in SQuAD format for model fine-tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Each QA pair includes:\n",
    "- **Context**: Natural language passage containing the answer\n",
    "- **Question**: Natural language question\n",
    "- **Answer**: The answer text with character position\n",
    "- **Confidence**: Quality score for the QA pair\n",
