    "# NBA Question Answering System\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the NBA QA system to answer questions about NBA players, teams, and games.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The NBA QA System uses a hybrid RAG-like approach:\n",
    "1. **Question Analysis**: Extracts entities (players, teams, stats, dates)\n",
    "2. **Data Retrieval**: Queries NBA API for relevant data\n",
    "3. **Context Generation**: Converts structured data to natural language\n",
    "4. **QA Model**: Uses Hugging Face QA model to extract answers\n",
    "5. **Answer Formatting**: Returns structured answers with sources\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- Answer questions about player statistics\n",
    "- Query game results and box scores\n",
    "- Compare players\n",
    "- Analyze play-by-play data\n",
    "- Query all-time league leaders in various statistical categories\n",
    "- Get formatted scores for the most recent team games\n",
    "- Works with both pre-trained and fine-tuned models\n"

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **NBA QA System is ready to use!**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Entity Extraction**: Automatically identifies players, teams, stats, and dates\n",
    "- **NBA API Integration**: Retrieves real-time data from official NBA API\n",
    "- **Context Generation**: Converts structured data to natural language\n",
    "- **QA Model**: Uses state-of-the-art question-answering models\n",
    "- **Source Citations**: Provides traceability to original data sources\n",
    "- **League Leaders**: Query all-time leaders in points, assists, rebounds, blocks, turnovers, steals, and 3-pointers\n",
    "- **Last Team Games**: Get formatted scores for the most recent games\n",
    "- **Career Averages**: Accurate per-game averages including turnovers and blocks\n",
    "- **Smart Player Matching**: Prioritizes full names to avoid ambiguity\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Be Specific**: Include player names, teams, or dates for better results\n",
    "2. **Use Abbreviations**: The system understands PPG, RPG, APG, etc.\n",
    "3. **Check Confidence**: Lower confidence scores may indicate ambiguous questions\n",
    "4. **View Details**: Use `answer_with_details()` to debug or understand the process\n",
    "5. **League Leaders**: Ask \"Who are the top N [stat] leaders?\" for formatted lists\n",
    "6. **Last Games**: Ask \"What was the score of the last [Team] game?\" for recent scores\n",
    "7. **Full Names**: Use full player names (e.g., \"Stephen Curry\") for better accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supported Question Types\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Player Statistics**: Career averages, season stats, recent games\n",
    "- **Game Results**: Scores, box scores, specific games\n",
    "- **Player Comparisons**: Compare stats between players\n",
    "- **League Leaders**: Top N players in any statistical category (all-time)\n",
    "- **Last Team Games**: Most recent game scores for any team\n",
    "- **Historical Data**: Questions about past seasons and games\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Try different question types\n",
    "- Compare pre-trained vs fine-tuned models\n",
    "- Integrate into your own applications\n",
    "- Extend with additional NBA API endpoints\n"
